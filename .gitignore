Certainly! Here's a simple code snippet to get your robot started:

```python
def start_robot():
    # Initialization steps for the robot

    # Connect to robot hardware
    connect_to_hardware()

    # Power on the robot
    power_on()

    # Perform startup calibration
    calibrate()

    # Start listening to user commands
    while True:
        command = get_user_command()

        if command == 'move_forward':
            move_forward()
        elif command == 'turn_left':
            turn_left()
        elif command == 'turn_right':
            turn_right()
        elif command == 'stop':
            stop()
        else:
            print("Invalid command!")

def connect_to_hardware():
    # Code to establish connection with robot hardware
    pass

def power_on():
    # Code to turn on the robot
    pass

def calibrate():
    # Code to perform initial calibration of robot sensors
    pass

def get_user_command():
    # Code to get user command (e.g., from a remote control or a user interface)
    pass

def move_forward():
    # Code to make the robot move forward
    pass

def turn_left():
    # Code to make the robot turn left
    pass

def turn_right():
    # Code to make the robot turn right
    pass

def stop():
    # Code to stop the robot
    pass

start_robot()
```

# Close the Chrome driver and quit the program
driver quit()
